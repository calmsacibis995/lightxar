<b>NAME</b>
       xar - eXtensible ARchiver

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>xar</b> <b>-</b>[<b>ctx</b>][<b>v</b>] <b>-f</b> <u>archive</u> [options] [<u>file</u> ...]]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  XAR  project  aims to provide an easily extensible archive format.
       Important design decisions include an easily extensible  XML  table  of
       contents  (TOC) for random access to archived files, storing the TOC at
       the beginning of  the  archive  to  allow  for  efficient  handling  of
       streamed  archives,  the  ability  to handle files of arbitrarily large
       sizes, the ability to choose independent encodings for individual files
       in  the archive, the ability to store checksums for individual files in
       both compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability to query the ta‐
       ble of content's rich meta-data.

<b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>options</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b>:

       -c     Creates an archive

       --create
              Synonym for -c

       -t     Lists the contents of an archive

       --list Synonym for -t

       -x     Extracts an archive

       --extract
              Synonym for -x

       --sign Creates  a  placeholder  signature and saves the data to sign to
              disk. Works with -c or just -f, requires --sig-size and  one  or
              more  --cert-loc  options  to be set. Setting the --data-to-sign
              and/or --sig-offset option is optional.

       --replace-sign
              Rips out  existing  signature(s)  and  makes  a  new  one.  Same
              required options as --sign, but only works with -f.

       --extract-data-to-sign
              Extracts  data  to  be signed from an existing archive. Requires
              --data-to-sign  (and  -f)  options  to  be  set.   Setting   the
              --sig-offset option is optional.

       --extract-certs=&lt;directory&gt;
              Extracts  all  certificates  into  DER  (binary) format into the
              specified directory naming them  "cert00",  "cert01"  etc.   The
              specified  directory must already exist.  "cert00" is always the
              leaf certificate.  "cert01", "cert02", etc. are only written  if
              the  xar  file  contains a certificate chain (i.e. more than the
              leaf signing certificate).  Any pre-existing files in the speci‐
              fied  directory of the same name as the certificates being writ‐
              ten will be overwritten without warning.

       --extract-CAfile=&lt;filename&gt;
              Extracts all certificates into  PEM  format,  concatenates  them
              together and stores the result into the specified file.

       --extract-sig=&lt;filename&gt;
              Extracts  the  signature  and stores it into the specified file.
              Setting the --sig-offset option is optional.

       --inject-sig=&lt;filename&gt;
              After extracting the data to be signed  and  doing  the  signing
              externally, injects the signature.  No attempt is made to verify
              that the signature being injected is valid other  than  that  it
              has   the   correct  length  as  previously  reserved  with  the
              --sig-size option.

       <b>NOTE:</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>-f</b> <b>option</b>  <b>(filename)</b>  <b>as</b>
       <b>this</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>xar</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>correctly</b> <b>handle</b> <b>pipes</b> <b>or</b> <b>sockets.</b>

       -f &lt;file&gt;
              The filename to use for creation, listing, extraction or signing
              operations.  With  extraction,  this  can  be  a  POSIX  regular
              expression.

       --file=&lt;file&gt;
              Synonym for -f &lt;file&gt;

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       --compression=&lt;type&gt;
              Specifies  the  compression  type  to  use.  Valid values: none,
              gzip, bzip2, lzma, xz.  Default value: gzip

       -a     Synonym for --compression=lzma

       -j     Synonym for --compression=bzip2

       -z     Synonym for --compression=gzip (Default)

       --compression-args=&lt;arguments&gt;
              Specifies arguments to the compression engine  selected.   gzip,
              bzip2, and lzma all take a single integer argument between 0 and
              9 specifying the compression level to use.

       --rfc6713
              Only affects --compression=gzip.  Force gzip compression to  use
              "application/zlib" as the encoding style name instead of "appli‐
              cation/x-gzip".  As of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6713">RFC 6713</a> this is the correct name to  use
              for  the  actual  compressed data format being stored in the ar‐
              chive.  This option will automatically be forced on by  the  xar
              library  if  a  --toc-cksum  value  other  than "none", "md5" or
              "sha1" is in effect.  Older  xar  versions  will  be  unable  to
              extract  files using this encoding (and neither will they under‐
              stand --toc-cksum values other than "none",  "md5"  or  "sha1").
              See <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6713">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6713</a> for details.

       -C &lt;path&gt;
              On  archive  or  extract,  xar  will chdir to the specified path
              before processing archive members being archived or extracted.

       --directory=&lt;path&gt;
              Synonym for -C &lt;path&gt;

       --dump-toc=&lt;filename&gt;
              Has xar dump the XML header into the specified file.  "-" can be
              specified to indicate stdout.

       -d &lt;filename&gt;
              Synonym for --dump-toc=&lt;filename&gt;

       --dump-toc-raw=&lt;filename&gt;
              Has xar dump the raw, compressed XML header data into the speci‐
              fied file.

       --dump-header
              Has xar print out the xar binary header information to stdout.

       --extract-subdoc=&lt;name&gt;
              Extracts the specified subdocument to a document  in  cwd  named
              &lt;name&gt;.xml

       --list-subdocs
              List the subdocuments in the XML header

       --toc-cksum
              Specifies  the hashing algorithm to use for XML header verifica‐
              tion.  Valid  values:  none,  sha1,  and  md5.   If  the  linked
              libcrypto  library  supports  them  sha224,  sha256,  sha384 and
              sha512 may also be used.  Setting this option to a stronger hash
              than  the default will also cause --file-cksum to be set to that
              hash unless it's been explicitly set to something else.  Default
              value: sha1

       --file-cksum
              Specifies  the  hashing  algorithm to use for file verification.
              Same values and defaults as --toc-cksum.  Setting this option to
              a  stronger hash than the default will also cause --toc-cksum to
              be set to that hash unless it's been explicitly set to something
              else.

       -l     On archival, stay on the local device.

       --one-file-system
              Synonym for -l

       -P     On  extract, set ownership based on uid/gid.  If the uid/gid can
              be set on the extracted file, setuid/setgid bits  will  also  be
              preserved.

       -p     On  extract, set ownership based on symbolic names, if possible.
              If the uid/gid can be set on the extracted  file,  setuid/setgid
              bits will also be preserved.

       -n &lt;name&gt;
              On  archival,  specifies the subdocument name to use when adding
              the -s &lt;filename&gt; subdocument instead of the default name  "sub‐
              doc".

       -s &lt;filename&gt;
              On  extract,  specifies the file to extract subdocuments to.  On
              archival, specifies an XML file to add as a subdocument.

       -v     Verbose output

       --verbose
              Synonym for -v

       --exclude=&lt;regexp&gt;
              Specifies a POSIX basic regular expression of files  to  exclude
              from  adding  to  the  archive  during  creation  or  from being
              extracted during extraction.  This option can be specified  mul‐
              tiple times.

       --strip-components=&lt;n&gt;
              When extracting, strip &lt;n&gt; path components from the front of the
              path before creating the destination file.  If  the  item  being
              extracted  does not have enough path components to strip &lt;n&gt; off
              then it will be skipped and not extracted.

       --to-stdout
              Instead of creating files during extraction, write the file con‐
              tents to standard output.  Only the file data will be written to
              standard output.  All extended attributes,  resource  forks  and
              other file properties are ignored with this option.

       -O     Synonym for --to-stdout

       --rsize
              Specifies  a size (in bytes) for the internal libxar read buffer
              while performing I/O.

       --coalesce-heap
              When multiple files in the archive are identical, only store one
              copy  of  the  data in the heap.  This creates smaller archives,
              but the archives created are not streamable.

       --link-same
              When the data section of multiple files are identical,  hardlink
              them within the archive.

       --recompress
              Normally  archived  files that are already compressed in a reco‐
              gized format will be archived but not compressed (as though they
              matched a --no-compress expression).  If this option is set then
              recompression of these files will be allowed (unless they  match
              an explicit --no-compress expression).

       --no-compress
              Specifies  a  POSIX  regular expression of files to archive, but
              not compress.  The archived files will be copied  raw  into  the
              archive.  This can be used to exclude already gzipped files from
              being gzipped during the archival process  when  using  --recom‐
              press  or  unrecognized-by-xar  compressed formats.  This option
              can be used multiple times.

       --prop-include=&lt;propname&gt;
              Specifies a file property to be included in the  archive.   When
              this  option  is  specified,  only the specified options will be
              included.  Anything not specifically included with  this  option
              will be omitted.  This option can be used multiple times.

       --prop-exclude=&lt;propname&gt;
              Specifies a file property to be excluded from the archive.  When
              this option is specified, all file properties will  be  included
              except  the  specified properties.  Note that excluding the "ea"
              property will exclude all extended attributes (including OS  X's
              resource fork).  This option can be used multiple times.

       --distribution
              Creates an archive to only contain file properties safe for file
              distribution.  Currently, only name, type, mode,  and  data  are
              preserved with this option.

       --keep-existing
              Does  not overwrite existing files during extraction.  Keeps any
              previously existing files while extracting.

       -k     Synonym for --keep-existing.

       --keep-setuid
              When extracting without -p or -P options, xar will extract files
              as  the  uid/gid  of the extracting process.  In this situation,
              xar will strip setuid/setgid bits from the extracted  files  for
              security reasons.  --keep-setuid will preserve the setuid/setgid
              bits even though the uid/gid of the extracted file  is  not  the
              same as the archived file.

       --sig-size=&lt;n&gt;
              Specifies the size in bytes of the signature placeholder to gen‐
              erate when using the --sign or --replace-sign options.

       --sig-len=&lt;n&gt;
              Synonym for --sig-size=&lt;n&gt;.

       --data-to-sign=&lt;file&gt;
              Has xar dump the raw data to be signed to  the  specified  file.
              This  is  simply the raw binary bytes of the --toc-cksum hash of
              the raw, compressed XML header  data.   Requires  a  --toc-cksum
              value  other than "none".  When generating a signature, this raw
              hash value must first have the proper DigestInfo prefix added to
              it   (see   <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447">RFC   3447</a>   sections  9.2,  A.2.4  and  B.1).   The
              --digestinfo-to-sign option automatically adds  the  appropriate
              prefix and should normally be used instead of this option.

       --digestinfo-to-sign=&lt;file&gt;
              Has  xar  dump the DigestInfo data to be signed to the specified
              file.  This is simply the raw binary bytes  of  the  --toc-cksum
              hash  of  the  raw,  compressed  XML header data preceded by the
              appropriate DigestInfo prefix (see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447">RFC 3447</a> sections 9.2,  A.2.4
              and  B.1).   Requires  a --toc-cksum value of "md5", "sha1" (the
              default), "sha224", "sha256", "sha384" or "sha512".

       --sig-offset=&lt;file&gt;
              Has xar dump the signature's byte offset within the archive  (as
              an   ASCII  decimal  number)  to  the  specified  file.   Always
              optional.

       --cert-loc=&lt;filename&gt;
              Specifies the location of a signing certificate in DER format to
              include  in the archive.  This option can be used multiple times
              to include a certificate chain.   The  first  --cert-loc  option
              should specify the leaf signing certificate, the next its issuer
              CA and so on so that the last --cert-loc= option  specifies  the
              root      certificate      authority      for     the     chain.
              --leaf-cert-loc=&lt;filename&gt;  and   --intermediate-cert-loc=&lt;file‐
              name&gt;  are  accepted  as synonyms for --cert-loc= for historical
              reasons.

       --help Show a help summary.

       -h     Synonym for --help

       -V     Synonym for --version

       --version
              Display the version number of xar.  If --verbose is given before
              --version show additional version information.

<b>TIPS</b>
       xar --replace-sign --sig-size=0 -f sample.xar

              Completely removes any signatures from sample.xar

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       xar -cf sample.xar /home/uid

              Create an xar archive of all files in /home/uid

       xar -tf sample.xar

              List the contents of the xar archive sample.xar

       xar -xf sample.xar

              Extract the contents of sample.xar to the current working direc‐
              tory

       xar -cf sample.xar --toc-cksum=whirlpool! \
              --file-cksum=whirlpool! /home/uid

              Create an xar archive  of  all  files  in  /home/uid  using  the
              whirlpool  message digest (requires EVP_get_digestbyname support
              for whirlpool)

<b>SIGNING</b>
       In order to sign an archive, a leaf signing certificate in  DER  format
       together  with its RSA private key in PEM format is required.  In addi‐
       tion, if the leaf signing certificate is not a  self-signed  root  cer‐
       tificate  then  all  the  other  certificates  in the certificate chain
       (including the root certificate) should also be available in  DER  for‐
       mat.

       The  example here assumes the DER format certificates from leaf to root
       are available in the files

              leaf.crt -&gt; intorg.crt -&gt; toporg.crt -&gt; root.crt

       and the leaf.crt private key is available in PEM  format  in  the  file
       key.pem.   Also the archive to be signed is archive.xar and the openssl
       and wc utility commands are available.  The example commands are for an
       sh-compatible shell.

       1. Determine the signature size

              : | openssl dgst -sign key.pem -binary | wc -c &gt; siglen.txt

       2. Extract the value to be signed and insert the certificates

              xar --sign -f archive.xar --digestinfo-to-sign digestinfo.dat \
                     --sig-size `cat siglen.txt` \
                     --cert-loc leaf.crt --cert-loc intorg.crt \
                     --cert-loc toporg.crt --cert-loc root.crt

       3. Create the RSA signature

              openssl rsautl -sign -inkey key.pem -in digestinfo.dat \
                     -out signature.dat

       4. Inject the RSA signature

              xar --inject-sig signature.dat -f archive.xar

       Step  1 simply places the size in bytes as an ASCII decimal number into
       the file siglen.txt.  For any given specific RSA private key, this step
       only  needs  to be done once as the length is determined by key charac‐
       teristics such as bit length, signing algorithm etc. that are  indepen‐
       dent of the data being signed.

       Step  2, despite the name of the --sign option, only reserves space for
       the signature to be injected in step 4, inserts  the  certificates  and
       extracts  the DigestInfo to be signed.  It does not create a valid sig‐
       nature.

       Step 3 actually creates the signature using the openssl tool.

       Step 4 inserts the real signature into the archive that previously  had
       space reserved for it.  This final step creates a signed archive.

       Note that whenever the archive data changes steps 2-4 must be repeated.
       Repeating some or none of those steps will result in an invalid  signa‐
       ture.   Furthermore,  xar  makes no attempt to verify that the injected
       signature is compatible with the leaf signing  certificate  (the  first
       --cert-loc  option).   For  example,  if the --toc-cksum type is "sha1"
       (the default) then the leaf signing certificate's  signature  algorithm
       must  be "sha1WithRSAEncryption" in order for the resulting xar archive
       to have a valid signature.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Doesn't currently work with pipes or streams.   Might  be  fixed  in  a
       future release.

       Signature  support  is  clumsy  and  requires multiple steps and use of
       external tools.

       Should default to SHA-256 checksums if supported by the linked  library
       but currently does not for backwards compatibility.

       The formatting in this man page is suboptimal.

       The   option   to  use  any  available  EVP_get_digestbyname  hash  for
       --toc-cksum and/or --file-cksum by simply appending an !  to  its  name
       remains mostly undocumented.

       Probably  one  or  two more in there somewhere.  If you find one please
       report it to:
